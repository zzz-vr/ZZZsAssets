* **Tingle** -- Thank you so much for your help in the past. I will miss you. Hope you are OK.

* **CryptoJen** -- Thank you for your contribution of the Battle Royale sound effects. For and only for these sound effects, you have written permission to provide a "Special thanks to Cryptojen." for the purposes of credits for those sound effects. While ZZZ helped, directed, and coordinated the creation of these effects, ZZZ is willing to forego their place in the credits for them if that would allow these effects to be used by more projects. For people who do not mind, ideally, you would credit both ZZZ and Cryptojen.

* **BOTDean** -- Thank you for your good work maintaining the several community oriented projects that you do.

* **MarkDey** -- Thank you for your contributions and assistance to various community projects.

**Content Descriptions**

* **ZZZWalls** -- This is a pack of special textures that I made with the assistance of Jhett. Any mapper making something like an office, hospital, prison, or police station should consider downloading and looking at the materials in this pack. They are optimized for performance in VR and extremely easy to use. The materials themselves include trim for the walls, two tone color options of the walls, a variety of customization features that allow for things like stripes of varying heights and designs. If you're building an office and using a generic "Plaster texture" -- you should consider using this instead as it will make your walls look pretty realistic. 

* **ZZZSpawnpoint** -- As seen on the map "ZZZ's Quake". This is a set of blue prints, attenuations, and sounds that work together with a spawnpoint or teleporter exit. This should be placed in the map above the ground, overlapping a Pavlov Player spawnpoint or teleporter exit. This should also be elevated so that a player walking on the ground will not bump into it. This is very ideal for adding atmosphere to your spawnpoints.

* **ZZZSpawnpoint** -- As seen on the map "ZZZ's Quake". This is a set of blue prints, attenuations, and sounds that will work together to create an elevator system with a variable for maximum height. The elevators are set to trigger when a player stands on them. They work and sound like standard Quake elevators.

* **ZZZBattleRoyaleFX** -- As seen on the map "ZZZ's Battlegrounds". This is a set of materials and sounds for the blue zone. If you're a Battle Royale mapper or someone who wants to see how these materials are constructed, this is for you.

* **ZZZMusicPlayerModel** -- As seen on the map "BR_Ruins". This is a gramophone model that was made by ZZZ for use by anyone per the request of BOTDean. It is low poly and performant. It is very ugly as minimal effort and only one iteration was used. BOTDean only wanted to use it as a button for their music player in the spectator area and so the logic was that anythng was better than nothing.
